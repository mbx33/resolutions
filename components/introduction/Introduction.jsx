			<p>
				Creating a plan for the new Year is a good habit. It will help you better
				understand all the successes and failures, and understand how much can
				happen in just a year. By learning from the mistakes of the past, you will
				be able to plan your future so that you donâ€™t repeat them and can manage
				your life better.

			<ul>
				<li>about 3 hours to summarize the past year</li>
				<li>about 1 hour to plan the New Year</li>
				<li>calendar for the previous year</li>
				<li>Be sincere and open</li>
